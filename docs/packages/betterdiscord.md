## Security

All plugin updates from our official repo are manually verified for malicious code.

## CSS Editor

BetterDiscord comes with a live CSS editor for debugging and basic UI tweaking.

## Developer Utils

Features for developers such as utility classes and a Plugin API come out of the box.

## Transparency

Enable transparency and use a transparent theme for a see-through window.

## Public Servers
